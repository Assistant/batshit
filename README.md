# batshit
 Template Script that runs in both BASH and BATCH

## Usage
Insert the bash code between the `Bash commands start` header and the `Bash commands end` footer. Each bash line must be prefaced with `REM `. (e.g., `REM echo "This command will run in bash."`) 

Insert the batch code between the `Batch commands start` header and the `Batch commands end` footer. Each batch line should be typed normally. (e.g., `echo This command will run in batch.`)

Everything between the headers and footers of the same type can be modified or deleted, including the headers. However, any code outside of the headers is vital.
